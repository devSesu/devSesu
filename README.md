GIS / Environmental Data Analyst

Hi, I'm Sesugh Amaakaven  

Python Data Analyst | Entry-Level Data Scientist | Environmental & Geospatial Analyst  

I’m thrilled about the insight that can be uncovered using data and the complex systems that can be understood, improved decision-making, and patterns that can be recognized, with their positive impact on the environment, communities, and businesses. My background in Geography and Environmental Science gives me a unique advantage in working with spatial data, field-based datasets, and real-world environmental challenges.  

I am actively building strong foundational skills in Python programming, data analysis, machine learning, and geospatial analytics. My goal is to develop into a versatile data professional capable of solving problems in three key areas: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Environmental/GIS Data Analytics.

ABOUT ME:
- M.Sc. Environmental Science (In-view) — Joseph Saawuan Tarka University, Makurdi  
- B.Sc. Geography— Benue State University, Makurdi  
- Experience with environmental data, spatial data interpretation, and scientific research  
- Strong interest in data analysis, predictive modelling, automation, and geospatial insights  
- Currently developing advanced skills in Python, machine learning, data visualization, and environmental analytics  
- Open to **remote roles** such as:  
  - Data Analyst  
  - Python Developer (Data-focused)  
  - Junior Machine Learning Engineer  
  - GIS/Environmental Analyst  
  - Research & Data Assistant  

What I Do

1. Data Analysis
I work with datasets to clean, transform, analyze, and visualize information to uncover trends and insights.

Tools & Skills:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, Excel, Jupyter Notebook  
Tasks I perform:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Precriptive data analysis (PDA)
- Creating charts, dashboards, and insights  
- Automating repetitive data tasks  
- Reporting and summarizing findings  

2. Machine Learning (Entry-Level)
I am building practical experience with classical machine learning models and end-to-end project structures.

Skills & Knowledge:
Scikit-learn, data splitting, model evaluation, regression, classification, clustering

Tasks I perform: 
- Handling datasets for modelling  
- Training and testing machine learning models  
- Analyzing model performance  
- Feature engineering  
- Implementing simple ML pipelines  

3. GIS & Environmental Data Analytics
With a background in Geography and Environmental Science, I love working with environmental datasets and spatial information.

Skills & Tools:
ArcGIS (foundational), GeoPandas (learning), environmental research methods  
Tasks I perform:
- Basic geospatial data handling and visualization  
- Time-series analysis of environmental indicators  
- Trend detection and pattern interpretation  
- Applying scientific reasoning to environmental datasets  

Technologies & Tools I Use
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- SQL (beginner–intermediate)  
- Git & GitHub  
- Excel  
- QGIS (basic)  

Projects I Am Working On (Coming Soon)
These three end-to-end projects will be added to my profile to demonstrate my skills across data analysis, machine learning, and geospatial/environmental analytics:

1. Real Estate Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)
   - Regression modelling  
   - Exploratory analysis  
   - Feature engineering  
   - Model evaluation  

2. Environmental Pollution Analysis (GIS/Environmental Analytics Project) 
   - Time-series analysis  
   - Trend detection  
   - Spatial interpretation (where applicable)  
   - Visualization and insight reporting  

3. Customer Segmentation Using K-Means (Data Analysis + Unsupervised ML)
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
   - Clustering and group insights  
   - Simple business interpretation  
   - Visual exploration  

These projects will demonstrate my ability to work with structured data, environmental data, and machine learning workflows.

Currently Learning
- Machine learning fundamentals  
- GeoPandas and geospatial Python workflows  
- Data visualization and dashboard creation  
- Python automation scripts
